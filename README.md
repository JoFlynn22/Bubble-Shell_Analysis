## Sorting Algorith Comparison

The code provided in this repository contains two sorting algorithms (Bubble and Shell) in which the number of inversions and the Chebyshev's distance is being compared with increasing number of elements. The final results, as well as visuals showing this analysis can be found in project6_report.pdf
